This project provides a concrete application to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). The aim of this problem is to propose a shuttle system to pick up employees at their home and bring them to the company location. To generate accurate data about the location of employees, we use data from the Swiss Confederation about the density of population. We then use the Google Maps API to get the exact travel times and distances between every employee considering the traffic. Our objective function is to minimize the total travel time. We provide an analysis for different number of shuttles and maximal time of travel for every shuttle.

The results show that that there is no single best scenario that can satisfy all the criteria. However, one scenario stands out from the others, which is the n°5. This scenario avoids the most CO2 emissions (1556 tons). There are 6 shuttles, and the average commuting time for the employees are 36 minutes more than commuting by private cars (34 minutes being the best time, in scenario 7). The resulting daily costs for the company 500 CHF (438 CHF being the lowest, in scenario 3). In consequence, the 5th scenario appears to be the most relevant one to go with !

Finally, different extensions to this problem are presented, which could be interesting in developing further this project.
