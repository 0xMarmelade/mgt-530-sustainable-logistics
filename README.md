This project provides a concrete application to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). The aim of this problem is to propose a shuttle system to pick up employees at their home and bring them to the company location. To generate accurate data about the location of employees, we use data from the Swiss Confederation about the density of population. We then use the Google Maps API to get the exact travel times and distances between every employee considering the traffic. Our objective function is to minimize the total travel time. We provide an analysis for different number of shuttles and maximal time of travel for every shuttle. At the end, our results show that: TBCC. Finally, we present different extensions to this problem that could be interesting to develop further.
